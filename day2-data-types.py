#Subscripting
print("Hello"[0]) # programmers always start counting from zero and also counts the space
#This method of pulling out a particular element from a string is called #subscripting


print("Hello"[4]) #
print("hello"[-1]) #negative indices -1 last character
print("Hello"[-2]) # from the end to the beginning <-

#123 is treated as a number
#"123" is treated as any other piece of text

#String
print("123" + "345") # Concatenation

#Integer = whole number -. write the number without anything else
print(123 + 345)

#Large Integers -> for large numbers we use to put commas
print(123_456_789) #in python we use Underscore _ between large numbers more readable,
#but the computer will treat as a whole large number and ignores the underscore

#Float = Floating point number (Decimal places)
print(3.14159)

#Boolean = True or False
print(True)
print(False)
#Booleans don't have quotation marks around them,
# otherwise it would turn them into a String. So it should be bool = False
